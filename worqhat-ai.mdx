The WorqHat AI API is a versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks involving natural language, code, and images. Our API provides various models with varying power levels, suitable for different tasks, and can be trained on the fly while generating outputs. With the flexibility to handle content generation, semantic search, and classification, our API offers a comprehensive solution for your needs.

## Models

We are proud to offer a suite of AI models that are built upon the foundation of four core
models. These models have been carefully developed to offer a range of capabilities in processing both images and text, allowing users to leverage the power of AI to unlock new insights and achieve better outcomes.

Our image processing models include ImageCon, which offers advanced image composition and face generation capabilities, and ImageEnhance, which enhances the quality and detail of images, making them clearer and more visually appealing.

For text processing, we offer AiCon, a powerful model that generates high-quality, coherent text
from prompts, and categorizes text into predefined categories, enabling users to quickly and accurately classify and analyze large volumes of text data.

All of our models are built on a foundation of cutting-edge AI techniques and are designed to be highly accurate, efficient, and scalable. Additionally, we offer an API that allows developers and researchers to build on top of our models, enabling them to leverage the power of AI in their own projects and applications.

By offering a suite of AI models that are based on these core capabilities, we are committed to helping our users unlock new insights and achieve better outcomes in their work.

### Text Generation

The text generation model is a powerful tool that can be used to generate text based on a prompt.
The model is trained on a large corpus of text, and can be fine-tuned to generate text in a
specific style or domain. The model can be used to generate text in a variety of styles,
including news articles, blog posts, and even poetry. You can use the model to generate text
content for your website, or to generate text for your chatbot.
