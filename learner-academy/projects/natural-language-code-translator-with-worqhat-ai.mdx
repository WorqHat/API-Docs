## AI, WorqHatAI, and AiCon Models

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, machines strive to simulate human intelligence, while machine learning focuses on enabling machines to learn and improve autonomously without explicit programming. In this context, WorqHat emerges as a groundbreaking no-code platform builder, harnessing the potential of Generative AI to create custom apps, workflows, and automation solutions tailored to businesses of all sizes.

WorqHat empowers solopreneurs, startups, and medium-sized enterprises by automating complex workflows, fostering seamless team collaboration, and enhancing overall productivity. By automating time-consuming tasks, WorqHat allows businesses to thrive and focus on core operations.

At the heart of WorqHat lies the advanced deep learning model known as AiCon (AI Content Optimization Network). This remarkable language model has undergone extensive training on vast volumes of data, enabling it to comprehend natural language with unparalleled precision and exceptional speed. The result? Faster and more streamlined platform building processes.

The WorqHatAI API serves as a powerful tool, providing developers with access to WorqHat's cutting-edge AI models and the ability to train their own models. WorqHat's AiCon models are generative language models developed to generate coherent text based on substantial data inputs. AiCon V2, the fastest language model offered by WorqHat, boasts self-training capabilities and can handle requests involving up to 100,000 words in a single go. For tasks requiring logical thinking and increased creativity, AiCon V3, a larger and more advanced model, comes into play.

To utilize WorqHat's API, developers must obtain an API key and an ORG key. These keys serve as access credentials and are essential for writing NodeJS programs that interact with WorqHat's API.

Before diving into writing your first program using NodeJS and the WorqHat API, let's take a moment to understand the concept of an API key and how you can generate one to facilitate seamless integration with WorqHat's powerful services.

## WorqHat API Key

In order to use the WorqHat API, you must first obtain an API key and the ORG Key. We offer a
generous free tier that gets reset every month. You can also upgrade to a paid plan to get more
API calls and more features.

This key serves
as a unique identifier that allows you to access WorqHat's API services. To generate an API key, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the [WorqHat API](https://worqhat.com) website and click on the **Get Started** button.
2. Join the WorqHat community by entering your email address and clicking on the **Join Now**
button. You can also sign up using your Google or Microsoft account.
3. Once you've signed up, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. Click on the **Create a
Workspace** button on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Add a name for your workspace and click on the **Create Workspace** button. We use workspaces
to organize your projects and keep them separate from each other. This allows you to manage your projects more efficiently.
5. Once you've created a workspace, you'll be redirected to the Workspace Signin page. Sign in to
your workspace using your email address and password that you have set up during the signup process.
6. After signing in, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. Click on the **Try Now** button on
the **Build Your Own Applications with our API** card.
7. You'll be redirected to the API page. You can find your API key and ORG key on the right-hand
side of the screen. Click on the **Copy** button to copy the keys to your clipboard.
8. Also, make sure to add your Domain name to the **Allowed Domains** section. This will allow
you to make API calls from your domain. For example, if you're making API calls from a website
hosted on `https://example.com`, you'll need to add `example.com` to the **Allowed Domains** section.

Here's an example of what the API key & ORG key looks like:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash API Key
  var myHeaders = new Headers();
  myHeaders.append("x-org-key",
  "U2FsdGVkX1+DMFucNFhZT7b3KTDTPLvjKkfWV0XY+jK2tA44wGn+M+KTC1V/eAOX");
  ```
  ```bash ORG Key
  var myHeaders = new Headers();
  myHeaders.append("x-api-key",
  "U2FsdGVkX1/hx889OFajtqRp5TdESHHakovIb3Qq52kqqy/zFhA9MlNSjghXMUzbOHEr9QhoOAJKmKXKA6Ol8A==");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Quick Start with WorqHatAI API

Now that you have your API key and ORG key, you can start using the WorqHat API. In this section,
we'll walk you through the process of writing your first NodeJS program using the WorqHat API.

### Step 1: Create a NodeJS App

1. First of all, install NodeJs in your system. Head over to https://nodejs.org/en/download and
follow the instructions to install it.
2. Head over to your terminal and create a new directory for your NodeJs app:

```bash [Terminal]
  mkdir my-nodejs-app
```

3. Navigate to the newly created directory:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  cd my-nodejs-app
  ```

4. Initialize a new NodeJs app and accept the default options:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  npm init -y
  ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install the `request` package. The `request` package allows you to make HTTP requests from your NodeJs app:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  npm install request
  ```

2. Install the `dotenv` package. The `dotenv` package allows you to load environment variables
from a `.env` file. This is useful when you want to keep your API keys and other sensitive information out of your codebase:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  npm install dotenv
  ```

### Step 3: Create the files

1. Create a new file called `index.js` and `.env` in the root directory of your NodeJs app:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  touch index.js .env
  ```

<iframe className="mt-6 w-full h-[400px]"
        src="https://www.tella.tv/video/clizx2ezq02090fl3fhxg8qm5/embed?b=0&title=1&a=1&loop=1&autoPlay=true&t=0&muted=1"></iframe>

2. After running the Commands, the directory structure should look like this:
<Frame caption="Directory Structure">
  <img src="/images/text-code-fs.png" />
</Frame>

Now, let’s move on to the coding part.

### Step 4: Write the code

1. Open the `.env` file and add the following code:

  ```bash .env
  WORQHAT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE
  WORQHAT_ORG_KEY=YOUR_ORG_KEY_GOES_HERE
  ```

2. Open the `index.js` file and add the following code. We are going to write a simple program
that will make a POST request to the WorqHat API with the Question/Command and print the
response to the console:

```javascript index.js
// Import the Request library to make requests to the WorqHat API
const request = require("request");
// Load the WorqHat AI API key from a file named ".env"
require("dotenv").config();
// Store the WorqHat API & ORG key in a variable for later use
const worqhatApiKey = process.env.WORQHAT_API_KEY;
const worqhatOrgKey = process.env.WORQHAT_ORG_KEY;

// Set the URL for the API request
const url = "https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v2";

// Set the required headers for the API request
const headers = {
    "x-api-key": worqhatApiKey, // Replace with your API key
    "x-org-key": worqhatOrgKey, // Replace with your ORG key
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

// Prepare the request body in JSON format
const raw = JSON.stringify({
    question: "Hi, tell me about you", // The question or command for the AI model
    preserve_history: false, // Whether to preserve conversation history for the model. Set to false for one-off questions. Visit documentation for more info.
    randomness: 0.4, // Level of randomness for AI model response (0 to 1)
});

// Configure the options for the API request
const requestOptions = {
    url: url,
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: raw,
};

// Send the API request
request(requestOptions, (error, response, body) => {
    if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
        console.log(body); // Print the response body if the request is successful
    } else {
        console.log("Error:", error); // Print the error message if the request fails
    }
});
```

### Step 5: Let's break down the code and understand what's going on

1. First, we import the `request` package to make HTTP requests from our NodeJs app:

```javascript index.js
const request = require("request");
```

2. Next, we import the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file:

```javascript index.js
require("dotenv").config();
```

3. Next, we store the WorqHat API key and ORG key in variables for later use:

```javascript index.js
const worqhatApiKey = process.env.WORQHAT_API_KEY;
const worqhatOrgKey = process.env.WORQHAT_ORG_KEY;
```

4. Next, we set the URL for the API request:

```javascript index.js
const url = "https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v2";
```

5. Next, we set the required headers for the API request:

```javascript index.js
const headers = {
   "x-api-key": worqhatApiKey, // Replace with your API key
   "x-org-key": worqhatOrgKey, // Replace with your ORG key
   "Content-Type": "application/json",
};
```

6. Next, we prepare the request body in JSON format. This is where we specify the question or
command for the AI model and send the request to the API to get the response:

```javascript index.js
const raw = JSON.stringify({
   question: "Hi, tell me about you", // The question or command for the AI model
   preserve_history: false, // Whether to preserve conversation history for the model. Set to false for one-off questions. Visit documentation for more info.
   randomness: 0.4, // Level of randomness for AI model response (0 to 1)
});
```

This block of code is where the magic happens. We are sending a ``POST`` request to the WorqHat API,
and we are passing the ``question/command`` to the API. The API will then process the question/command
and return the ``response``.

* **question**: The question or command for the AI model (required)
* **preserve_history**: Whether to preserve conversation history for the model. Set to false for
one-off questions. You can also pass in custom training data and conversation history in the for
of Key-Value Pairs. Visit [documentation](https://devs.worqhat.com/WorqHatAPIs/AiText/aiconV2#sample-code) for more info.
* **randomness**: Level of randomness for AI model response (0 to 1). The higher the randomness, the
more varied the response will be.

7. Next, we configure the options for the API request:

```javascript index.js
const requestOptions = {
   url: url,
   method: "POST",
   headers: headers,
   body: raw,
};
```

This is where we specify the URL, HTTP method, headers, and request body that we have prepared
and send the request to the WorqHat API  to process the question/command and return the response.

8. Finally, we send the API request:

```javascript index.js
request(requestOptions, (error, response, body) => {
   if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
       console.log(body); // Print the response body if the request is successful
   } else {
       console.log("Error:", error); // Print the error message if the request fails
   }
});
```

This is where we send the API request to the WorqHat API and get the response. We are using the
`request` package to send the request. We are also checking if the request is successful or not
and printing the response body or error message accordingly.

### Step 6: Run the code

Now that we have written the code, let's run it and see what happens. To run the code, open the
terminal and run the following command:

```bash Terminal
node index.js
```

You should see the following output in the terminal:

```bash Terminal
{
  "id": "1d9affa3-deac-49ee-87e7-a8d0397826fb",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": 1683057609614,
  "content": "I was built by WorqHat, a Generative AI Based No-Code Platform Builder based on the Advanced LLM Model AiCon. It's a predictive technology that is designed to make building applications faster and easier. Is there anything you need help with?",
  "processing_count": 58
}
```

This is the response from the WorqHat API. The response contains the following information:

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``id`` | The unique ID of the response | 1d9affa3-deac-49ee-87e7-a8d0397826fb |
| ``status`` | The status of the response | success |
| ``timestamp`` | The timestamp of the response | 1683057609614 |
| ``content`` | The response from the AI model | I was built by WorqHat, a Generative AI Based No-Code Platform Builder based on the Advanced LLM Model AiCon. It's a predictive technology that is designed to make building applications faster and easier. Is there anything you need help with? |
| ``processing_count`` | The number of times the question/command was processed by the AI model | 58 |


<Check>Note: This code is using the super powerful AiCon V2 model from the WorqHat AI API, which is
  famous
  for
  generating some seriously impressive text. However, it's important to use the API in a responsible
  and ethical way, and be mindful of the model's limitations to avoid any misuse.</Check>

</Frame>


Well done! You've successfully set up your development environment. Now let's start building our
code translator application.

### Building the Code Translator Application

A brief summary of what we will be doing to create our application.

This code serves as the foundation for building a text-to-code generator application using Next.js and the WorqHat AI engine. The application allows users to input natural language queries and receive corresponding code snippets in their chosen programming language.

The code begins by importing the necessary dependencies, including React's ``useState``, Next.js modules, and other required libraries.

The main component, ``HomePage``, is defined, which acts as the entry point for the home page of the application. It includes the necessary metadata and the ``Home`` component.

The ``Home`` component handles the user interface and logic for generating code from natural language input. It utilizes the ``useState`` hook to manage the component's state, including the ``selected language``, ``entered text``, ``generated code``, and ``loading status``.

The component dynamically imports the Editor component using Next.js' dynamic function, ensuring it is only loaded on the client-side.

Two important functions, ``createPrompt`` and ``fetchAIResponse``, are defined to facilitate the generation of code from natural language. The ``createPrompt`` function generates a prompt based on the selected language and user input, while the ``fetchAIResponse`` function performs an asynchronous HTTP request to the WorqHat AI API, passing the prompt and receiving the AI-generated code response.

The user interface is rendered using ``JSX``, which includes input fields for the question and
language selection, a button to trigger code generation, and an embedded code editor ``(Monaco
Editor)`` to display the generated code. The UI elements are styled using CSS classes of
``TailwindCSS``.

The code also handles events, such as the button click event to initiate code generation, and updates the component's state accordingly.

We will be covering all the necessary ``structure``, ``logic``, and ``user interface components`` to build a
text-to-code generator application. By leveraging the ``WorqHat AI engine`` and ``Next.js``, users can input natural language queries and obtain corresponding code snippets, enhancing their programming experience and facilitating better collaboration and comprehension.

### Let's Create the Frontend of the Application

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications with server-side rendering capabilities. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the entry point for a Next.js application and customizing the initial HTML document. We will also focus on the index.js file, which serves as the main starting point for our application.

The first step in building our application is to create the home page design and layout. We will be using ``TailwindCSS`` to style our application. TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom user interfaces. It provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to style HTML elements.

#### Step 1: Removing Unnecessary Files

Before we begin, let's remove any unnecessary files from our project. In this case, we can safely remove the "apis" directory since we won't be using it in this tutorial

#### Step 2: Understanding the ``_app.js`` File

The _app.js file serves as the entry point for our Next.js application. It acts as a wrapper component for all other components in the application and allows us to define global styles. Let's take a closer look at the code:

```javascript _app.js
import '../styles/globals.css';

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
   return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default App;
```

- We import the global styles defined in the "globals.css" file. These styles will be applied
globally throughout our application.
- The `App` component is a functional component that receives two parameters: `Component` and `pageProps`.
- Inside the `App` component, we render the `Component` using JSX syntax, spreading the `pageProps` as
props to the `Component`. This ensures that the initial props for the page component are passed down correctly.

#### Step 3: Understanding the ``_document.js`` File

The _document.js file allows us to customize the initial HTML document that is sent to the browser. Let's understand the code:

```javascript _document.js
export default function Document() {
   return (
      <Html lang="en">
         <Head />
         <body>
            <Main />
            <NextScript />
         </body>
      </Html>
   );
}
```

- We import specific components from the ``next/document`` module: ``Html``, ``Head``, ``Main``, and ``NextScript``.
These components are provided by Next.js and are used to define the structure and content of the HTML document.
- The ``Document`` function is a React functional component that returns JSX code.
- The JSX code represents the structure and content of the HTML document.
- The ``<Html>`` component is the root element of the document and includes an optional `lang`
attribute set to "en" to specify the language as English.

The ``<body>`` element is where the main content of the page resides. Inside the ``<body>``, we have two components: ``<Main>`` and ``<NextScript>``.
The ``<Main>`` component acts as a placeholder for the main content of the page.
The ``<NextScript>`` component includes the necessary Next.js scripts and other resources.

#### Step 4: Starting from Scratch in ``index.js``

To begin, we need to import the necessary modules. In our case, we will use the next/image module to include images and the next/font/google module to configure custom fonts. Add the following lines at the beginning of the index.js file:

```javascript index.js
import Image from 'next/image';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
```

#### Step 5: Configuring Custom Fonts

Next, we will configure a custom font for our application using the Inter font from Google Fonts. We will assign it to the inter constant. Update your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

#### Step 6: Building the Homepage Component

Now, let's define the homePage component, which will represent our homepage. Replace the existing code in the index.js file with the following:

```javascript index.js
function homePage() {
   return (
           <main>
              This is the sample code.
           </main>
   );
}

export default homePage;
```

In this code, we define the ``homePage`` function as a React functional component. It returns JSX code representing the main content of the homepage. The ``<main>`` element contains the text "This is the sample code."

To view the changes you've made in the code on the actual webpage, follow these simple steps:

- Save the changes you've made to the code.
- Ensure that your Next.js application is up and running. If not, start the development server by
executing the appropriate command, such as npm run dev or yarn dev.
- Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where your Next.js application is hosted. Typically,
this would be http://localhost:3000.
- Once the page loads, you will see the updated content displayed on the screen. In this case,
the text "This is the sample code" will be shown within a `<main>` element.

#### Step 7: Let's add the background styling to the homepage

Now, let's add some styling to the homepage. We will use standard CSS to style the background of
the page. Update your code in ``body tag`` as follows:

```css globals.css
html, body {
   margin: 0;
   padding: 0;
   height: 100%;
}

body {
   background: linear-gradient(135deg, #efb0b0, #e6b1f1, #9aa6ef) no-repeat;
   background-size: cover;
}
```

The provided CSS code sets the `html` and `body` elements to have no margin or padding, and a height of 100% to occupy the full viewport height. The `body` element is styled with a linear gradient background that starts in the top-left corner and moves to the bottom-right corner. The `background-size` property is set to `cover` to ensure the background image covers the entire background area, creating a visually appealing full-screen background effect for the webpage.

#### Step 8: Adding the Homepage Components

We will now add the components that will be displayed on the homepage. We will create a new
function called ``HomeComponents`` that will return the JSX code for the components. Update
your code as follows:

```javascript [index.js]
function HomeComponents(){
   return (
           <div className="text-black">
              <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl text-center mt-8 font-bold">Text to Code Generator</h1>
              <div className="text-center mt-8 text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold">
                 Generate Code from Natural Language using WorqHat AI in a Click!
              </div>

              <div className="container">
                 <div className="mb-6">
                    <input type="text" id="textbox1" placeholder="Enter your Question here"
                           className="block mx-auto w-full p-4 text-gray-900 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 sm:text-md focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500">
                    </input>
                 </div>
                 <select id="language" className="mx-auto mb-6 bg-gray-50 border border-gray-300 text-gray-900 text-sm rounded-lg focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 block w-full p-4">
                    <option value="">Select language</option>
                    <option value="c++">C++</option>
                    <option value="python">Python</option>
                    <option value="java">Java</option>
                    <option value="javascript">JavaScript</option>
                    <option value="c#">C#</option>
                    <option value="ruby">Ruby</option>
                    <option value="go">Go</option>
                    <option value="swift">Swift</option>
                    <option value="php">PHP</option>
                    <option value="typescript">TypeScript</option>
                    <option value="kotlin">Kotlin</option>
                    <option value="rust">Rust</option>
                    <option value="matlab">MATLAB</option>
                    <option value="r">R</option>
                    <option value="perl">Perl</option>
                    <option value="scala">Scala</option>
                    <option value="objective-c">Objective-C</option>
                    <option value="groovy">Groovy</option>
                    <option value="lua">Lua</option>
                    <option value="bash">Bash</option>
                    <option value="powershell">PowerShell</option>
                 </select>

                 <div className="w-full text-center">
                    <button id="generateButton"
                            className="mx-auto text-white bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-600 to-blue-500 hover:bg-gradient-to-bl focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 rounded-lg text-xl px-5 py-2.5 text-center mr-2 mb-2">
                       Generate Code
                    </button>
                 </div>
              </div>
           </div>
   );
}
```

In this code, we define the ``HomeComponents`` function as a React functional component. It returns JSX code representing the components that will be displayed on the homepage. The ``<div>`` element contains the following components:

- ``<h1>`` element containing the text "Text to Code Generator"
- ``<div>`` element containing the text "Generate Code from Natural Language using WorqHat AI in a Click!"
- ``<div>`` element containing the following components:
- ``<input>`` element for entering the question
- ``<select>`` element for selecting the programming language
- ``<button>`` element for generating the code
- ``<div>`` element for displaying the generated code

We need to style the container properly as well. We will use CSS to style the container. Update
your code in ``globals.css`` as follows:

```css globals.css
.container {
    color: black;
    max-width: 90%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin-top: 70px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

The provided CSS code sets the ``.container`` class to have a black text color, a maximum width of 90%, a top margin of 70px, and a padding of 20px. The background color is set to #f5f5f5, and the border radius is set to 8px. The box shadow is set to 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) to create a shadow effect for the container.

Now we will add the ``HomeComponents`` function to the ``homePage`` function. Update your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
function homePage(){
    return(
        <main>
            <HomeComponents></HomeComponents>
        </main>
    )
}
```
#### Step 9: Adding the Code Editor

We will now add the code editor component to the homepage. We will create a new function called
``CodeEditor`` that will return the JSX code for the code editor. We will be using [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for the code editor. Update your code as follows:

First we need to install the ``@monaco-editor/react`` package. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install @monaco-editor/react
```

```javascript index.js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const Editor = dynamic(() => import('@monaco-editor/react'), {ssr: false});
```

The ``Editor`` component is imported from the ``@monaco-editor/react`` package. The ``dynamic`` function is used to import the component dynamically. The ``ssr`` option is set to false to prevent the component from being rendered on the server.

Now we will create the ``CodeEditor`` inside the HomeComponents. Update your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
<div className="edit">
    <Editor
        height="400px"
        language="javascript"
        theme="vs-dark"
        defaultValue="// Generated code will appear here"
        defaultLanguage="javascript"
        value="// Generated code will appear here"
        options={{
            readOnly: true,
            wordWrap: "wordWrapRow", // Enable word wrapping at a specific column
            wordWrapRow: 10,
        }}
    />
    <br />
</div>
```

Add this after the ``<button>`` element in the ``HomeComponents`` function. The ``<div>`` element contains the ``<Editor>`` component. The ``<Editor>`` component has the properties to render the code that is being written.

The ``<div>`` element contains the ``<Editor>``
component. The ``<Editor>`` component has the properties to render the code that is being written.

Now that we are halfway through the project, at this stage, your Project should be looking
something like this:


<Frame caption="Your Application Halfway">
  <img src="/images/text-code-halfway.png" />
</Frame>


#### Step 10: Lets work on Handling the button clicks

We will now add the code to handle the button clicks. We will create a new function called
``handleGenerateCodeClick`` that will handle the button clicks. Update your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
  const handleGenerateCodeClick = async () => {

    const language = document.getElementById('language').value;
    const questionText = document.getElementById('textbox1').value;
};
```

The ``handleGenerateCodeClick`` function is defined as an asynchronous function. It gets the
value of the ``language`` and ``questionText`` variables from the ``<select>`` and ``<input>``
elements respectively. We will use these variables to generate the code. Now there are a few
things we need to add as a functionality as well:

- We need to create a Function that will call the API and get the response.
- We need to create a Function that will create the Command that needs to be sent to the API.
- We need to display the code response from the API.
- We need to add a loader to show that the code is being generated.

#### Step 11: Creating the Fetch Request

We will now create a new function called ``fetchAIResponse`` that will call the API and get the
response. Update your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
async function fetchAIResponse(selectedLanguage, question) {
    const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v2';

    const API_KEY = process.env.WORQHAT_API_KEY;
    const ORG_KEY = process.env.WORQHAT_ORG_KEY;

    console.log(API_KEY);

    const prompt = "This is the command that will be sent to the API"

    const requestOptions = {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-api-key': API_KEY,
            'x-org-key': ORG_KEY,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            question: prompt,
            randomness: 0.4,
        }),
    };

    const response = await fetch(API_ENDPOINT, requestOptions);
    return await response.json();
}
```

The ``fetchAIResponse`` function is defined as an asynchronous function. It gets the value of
the ``selectedLanguage`` and ``question`` variables from the ``<select>`` and ``<input>`` that
we will be passing as parameters to the function. We will use these variables to generate the
code. The ``fetchAIResponse`` function will return the response from the API.

Now we have to add the variables to the environment variables. Create a new file called
``.env`` in the root directory of the project. Add the following code to the file:

```bash .env
WORQHAT_API_KEY=YOUR_WORQHAT_API_KEY
WORQHAT_ORG_KEY=YOUR_WORQHAT_ORG_KEY
```

In order to get the API keys, you will need to create an account on [WorqHat](https://worqhat.com). Once you have created an account, you will be able to get the API keys from the [API Keys](https://app.worqhat.com/api-keys) page.

Now to access the API keys in the code, we will need to add it to the ``next,config.js`` file.
Update your code as follows:

```javascript next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
require('dotenv').config();

module.exports = {
    reactStrictMode: true,
    env: {
        WORQHAT_API_KEY: process.env.WORQHAT_API_KEY,
        WORQHAT_ORG_KEY: process.env.WORQHAT_ORG_KEY,
    },
};
```

This code is a Next.js configuration file that demonstrates how to use environment variables in a Next.js application. It loads environment variables from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` package. The `nextConfig` object contains Next.js configuration options, and `reactStrictMode` is set to `true` to enable strict mode for React. The `env` object exposes environment variables `WORQHAT_API_KEY` and `WORQHAT_ORG_KEY`, which are assigned values from the corresponding environment variables in the `.env` file. This approach helps keep sensitive information secure and allows for flexible configuration across different environments.

#### Step 12: Creating the function to create the ``Command``

We will now create a new function called ``createPrompt`` that will create the Command that
needs to be sent to the API. Update your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
const createPrompt = (inputLanguage, inputCode) => {
  return endent`
  You are an expert programmer in all programming languages. Translate the natural language to "${inputLanguage}" code. Do not include \\\\.

      Example translating from natural language to JavaScript:

      Natural language:
      Print the numbers 0 to 9.

  JavaScript code:
      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          console.log(i);
      }

  Natural language:
      ${inputCode}

      ${inputLanguage} code (no \\\\):
  `;
};
```

The ``createPrompt`` function is defined as a function. It gets the value of the ``inputLanguage`` and ``inputCode`` variables from the ``<select>`` and ``<input>`` that we will be passing as parameters to the function. We will use these variables to generate the code. The ``createPrompt`` function will return the Command that needs to be sent to the API.

We have used ``endent`` to format the Command. ``endent`` is a JavaScript template literal tag
that strips leading whitespace from multi-line strings. It is used to format the Command in a
readable way. We have created the Command in such a way that it will be easy for the AI to
generate the code.

Now we will update the ``fetchAIResponse`` function to call the ``createPrompt`` function. Update
your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
async function fetchAIResponse(selectedLanguage, question) {
    const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v2';

    const API_KEY = process.env.WORQHAT_API_KEY;
    const ORG_KEY = process.env.WORQHAT_ORG_KEY;

    console.log(API_KEY);

    const prompt = createPrompt(selectedLanguage, question);

    const requestOptions = {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-api-key': API_KEY,
            'x-org-key': ORG_KEY,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            question: prompt,
            randomness: 0.4,
        }),
    };

    const response = await fetch(API_ENDPOINT, requestOptions);
    return await response.json();
}
```

#### Step 13: Running the function once the user clicks on the ``Generate Code`` button

We will now update the ``generateCode`` function to call the ``fetchAIResponse`` function. Update
your code as follows:

```javascript index.js
const handleGenerateCodeClick = async () => {

    const language = document.getElementById('language').value;
    const questionText = document.getElementById('textbox1').value;

    let responseData = await fetchAIResponse(language, questionText);
    if (responseData?.status == 'success') {
        console.log(responseData);
    } else {
        console.log('Error');
    }
};
```

This code snippet sends a request to an AI service by calling the `fetchAIResponse()` function with the `language` and `questionText` parameters. It then waits for the response using the `await` keyword.

If the `responseData` object exists and its `status` property is equal to `'success'`, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed. In this case, the code logs the `responseData` object to the console using `console.log()`. This is useful for debugging and inspecting the response data received from the AI service.

If the `responseData` object does not meet the success condition, meaning the API call was not successful, the code block inside the `else` statement is executed. In this case, the code simply logs the string `'Error'` to the console.

We also need to Print this code into the ``code-editor`` that we have created earlier. You need to update the ``handleGenerateCodeClick`` function as follows:

We first need to import the ``useState`` hook from ``react``. The ``useState`` hook is a function that allows you to create state variables inside a React component. It accepts an initial value as an argument and returns an array containing the state variable and a function to update the state variable. We will use the `useState()` hook to create a state variable called `generatedCode` and a function called `setGeneratedCode()` to update the state variable.

```javascript index.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

```javascript [index.js]
const [generatedCode, setGeneratedCode] = useState('');
const [selectedLanguage,setSelectedLanguage] = useState('');

const handleGenerateCodeClick = async () => {

    const language = document.getElementById('language').value;
    const questionText = document.getElementById('textbox1').value;

    let responseData = await fetchAIResponse(language, questionText);
    if (responseData?.status == 'success') {

        let responseCode = responseData?.content || '';
        if (responseCode.includes('```')) {
            responseCode = responseCode.split('```')[1];
            setGeneratedCode(responseCode);
        } else {
            setGeneratedCode(`${responseCode}`);
        }

    } else {
        setGeneratedCode('Sorry, we could not generate code for your question. Please try again.');
    }
};
```

We have updated the ``handleGenerateCodeClick`` function to set the ``generatedCode`` state
variable to the code generated by the AI service. We have also updated the
``handleGenerateCodeClick`` function to set the ``selectedLanguage`` state variable to the
language selected by the user. We are passing these variables to the ``code-editor`` component
as props.

The ``code-editor`` component will be updated to accept these props and display the generated
code in the editor. Update the ``code-editor`` component as follows:

```javascript [code-editor.js]
<div className="edit">
    <Editor
        height="400px"
        language={selectedLanguage}
        theme="vs-dark"
        defaultValue="// Generated code will appear here"
        defaultLanguage="javascript"
        value={setGeneratedCode}
        options={{
            readOnly: true,
            wordWrap: "wordWrapRow", // Enable word wrapping at a specific column
            wordWrapRow: 10,
        }}
    />
    <br />
</div>
```

We have updated the ``code-editor`` component to accept the ``selectedLanguage`` and
``generatedCode`` props. We have also updated the ``code-editor`` component to display the
generated code in the editor.

Now we can add the Loading indicator to the ``Generate Code`` button. This will help the user
know that the code is being generated. Update the ``handleGenerateCodeClick`` function as follows:

```javascript [index.js]
const [generatedCode, setGeneratedCode] = useState('');
const [selectedLanguage,setSelectedLanguage] = useState('');
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

const handleGenerateCodeClick = async () => {

    const language = document.getElementById('language').value;
    const questionText = document.getElementById('textbox1').value;

    setLoading(true);
    setSelectedLanguage(language)


    let responseData = await fetchAIResponse(language, questionText);
    if (responseData?.status == 'success') {

        let responseCode = responseData?.content || '';
        if (responseCode.includes('```')) {
            responseCode = responseCode.split('```')[1];
            setGeneratedCode(responseCode);
            setLoading(false);
        } else {
            setGeneratedCode(`${responseCode}`);
            setLoading(false);
        }

    } else {
        setGeneratedCode('Sorry, we could not generate code for your question. Please try again.');
        setLoading(false);
    }
};
```

We have updated the ``handleGenerateCodeClick`` function to set the ``loading`` state variable
to ``true`` when the user clicks on the ``Generate Code`` button. We have also updated the
``handleGenerateCodeClick`` function to set the ``loading`` state variable to ``false`` when
the code is generated or an error occurs.

We have also updated the ``Generate Code`` button to display the Loading indicator when the
``loading`` state variable is ``true``. Update the ``Generate Code`` button as follows:

```javascript [index.js]
<button id="generateButton" className="mx-auto text-white bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-600 to-blue-500 hover:bg-gradient-to-bl focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 rounded-lg text-xl px-5 py-2.5 text-center mr-2 mb-2" onClick={handleGenerateCodeClick}>
    {loading ? `Writing your Code ....` : 'Generate Code'}
</button>
```

We have updated the ``Generate Code`` button to display the Loading indicator (`Writing your Code ....`) when the
``loading`` state variable is ``true``. We have also updated the ``Generate Code`` button to
display the ``Generate Code`` text when the ``loading`` state variable is ``false``
