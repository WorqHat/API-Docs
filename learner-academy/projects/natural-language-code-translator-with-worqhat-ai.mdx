## AI, WorqHatAI, and AiCon Models

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, machines strive to simulate human intelligence, while machine learning focuses on enabling machines to learn and improve autonomously without explicit programming. In this context, WorqHat emerges as a groundbreaking no-code platform builder, harnessing the potential of Generative AI to create custom apps, workflows, and automation solutions tailored to businesses of all sizes.

WorqHat empowers solopreneurs, startups, and medium-sized enterprises by automating complex workflows, fostering seamless team collaboration, and enhancing overall productivity. By automating time-consuming tasks, WorqHat allows businesses to thrive and focus on core operations.

At the heart of WorqHat lies the advanced deep learning model known as AiCon (AI Content Optimization Network). This remarkable language model has undergone extensive training on vast volumes of data, enabling it to comprehend natural language with unparalleled precision and exceptional speed. The result? Faster and more streamlined platform building processes.

The WorqHatAI API serves as a powerful tool, providing developers with access to WorqHat's cutting-edge AI models and the ability to train their own models. WorqHat's AiCon models are generative language models developed to generate coherent text based on substantial data inputs. AiCon V2, the fastest language model offered by WorqHat, boasts self-training capabilities and can handle requests involving up to 100,000 words in a single go. For tasks requiring logical thinking and increased creativity, AiCon V3, a larger and more advanced model, comes into play.

To utilize WorqHat's API, developers must obtain an API key and an ORG key. These keys serve as access credentials and are essential for writing NodeJS programs that interact with WorqHat's API.

Before diving into writing your first program using NodeJS and the WorqHat API, let's take a moment to understand the concept of an API key and how you can generate one to facilitate seamless integration with WorqHat's powerful services.

## WorqHat API Key

In order to use the WorqHat API, you must first obtain an API key and the ORG Key. We offer a
generous free tier that gets reset every month. You can also upgrade to a paid plan to get more
API calls and more features.

This key serves
as a unique identifier that allows you to access WorqHat's API services. To generate an API key, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the [WorqHat API](https://worqhat.com) website and click on the **Get Started** button.
2. Join the WorqHat community by entering your email address and clicking on the **Join Now**
button. You can also sign up using your Google or Microsoft account.
3. Once you've signed up, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. Click on the **Create a
Workspace** button on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Add a name for your workspace and click on the **Create Workspace** button. We use workspaces
to organize your projects and keep them separate from each other. This allows you to manage your projects more efficiently.
5. Once you've created a workspace, you'll be redirected to the Workspace Signin page. Sign in to
your workspace using your email address and password that you have set up during the signup process.
6. After signing in, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. Click on the **Try Now** button on
the **Build Your Own Applications with our API** card.
7. You'll be redirected to the API page. You can find your API key and ORG key on the right-hand
side of the screen. Click on the **Copy** button to copy the keys to your clipboard.
8. Also, make sure to add your Domain name to the **Allowed Domains** section. This will allow
you to make API calls from your domain. For example, if you're making API calls from a website
hosted on `https://example.com`, you'll need to add `example.com` to the **Allowed Domains** section.

Here's an example of what the API key & ORG key looks like:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash API Key
  var myHeaders = new Headers();
  myHeaders.append("x-org-key",
  "U2FsdGVkX1+DMFucNFhZT7b3KTDTPLvjKkfWV0XY+jK2tA44wGn+M+KTC1V/eAOX");
  ```
  ```bash ORG Key
  var myHeaders = new Headers();
  myHeaders.append("x-api-key",
  "U2FsdGVkX1/hx889OFajtqRp5TdESHHakovIb3Qq52kqqy/zFhA9MlNSjghXMUzbOHEr9QhoOAJKmKXKA6Ol8A==");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Quick Start with WorqHatAI API

Now that you have your API key and ORG key, you can start using the WorqHat API. In this section,
we'll walk you through the process of writing your first NodeJS program using the WorqHat API.

### Step 1: Create a NodeJS App

1. First of all, install NodeJs in your system. Head over to https://nodejs.org/en/download and
follow the instructions to install it.
2. Head over to your terminal and create a new directory for your NodeJs app:

```bash [Terminal]
  mkdir my-nodejs-app
```

3. Navigate to the newly created directory:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  cd my-nodejs-app
  ```

4. Initialize a new NodeJs app and accept the default options:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  npm init -y
  ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install the `request` package. The `request` package allows you to make HTTP requests from your NodeJs app:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  npm install request
  ```

2. Install the `dotenv` package. The `dotenv` package allows you to load environment variables
from a `.env` file. This is useful when you want to keep your API keys and other sensitive information out of your codebase:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  npm install dotenv
  ```

### Step 3: Create the files

1. Create a new file called `index.js` and `.env` in the root directory of your NodeJs app:

  ```bash [Terminal]
  touch index.js .env
  ```

<iframe className="mt-6 w-full h-[400px]"
        src="https://www.tella.tv/video/clizx2ezq02090fl3fhxg8qm5/embed?b=0&title=1&a=1&loop=1&autoPlay=true&t=0&muted=1"></iframe>

2. After running the Commands, the directory structure should look like this:
<Frame caption="Directory Structure">
  <img src="/images/text-code-fs.png" />
</Frame>

Now, let’s move on to the coding part.

### Step 4: Write the code

1. Open the `.env` file and add the following code:

  ```bash .env
  WORQHAT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE
  WORQHAT_ORG_KEY=YOUR_ORG_KEY_GOES_HERE
  ```

2. Open the `index.js` file and add the following code. We are going to write a simple program
that will make a POST request to the WorqHat API with the Question/Command and print the
response to the console:

```javascript index.js
// Import the Request library to make requests to the WorqHat API
const request = require("request");
// Load the WorqHat AI API key from a file named ".env"
require("dotenv").config();
// Store the WorqHat API & ORG key in a variable for later use
const worqhatApiKey = process.env.WORQHAT_API_KEY;
const worqhatOrgKey = process.env.WORQHAT_ORG_KEY;

// Set the URL for the API request
const url = "https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v2";

// Set the required headers for the API request
const headers = {
    "x-api-key": worqhatApiKey, // Replace with your API key
    "x-org-key": worqhatOrgKey, // Replace with your ORG key
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

// Prepare the request body in JSON format
const raw = JSON.stringify({
    question: "Hi, tell me about you", // The question or command for the AI model
    preserve_history: false, // Whether to preserve conversation history for the model. Set to false for one-off questions. Visit documentation for more info.
    randomness: 0.4, // Level of randomness for AI model response (0 to 1)
});

// Configure the options for the API request
const requestOptions = {
    url: url,
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: raw,
};

// Send the API request
request(requestOptions, (error, response, body) => {
    if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
        console.log(body); // Print the response body if the request is successful
    } else {
        console.log("Error:", error); // Print the error message if the request fails
    }
});
```

### Step 5: Let's break down the code and understand what's going on

1. First, we import the `request` package to make HTTP requests from our NodeJs app:

```javascript index.js
const request = require("request");
```

2. Next, we import the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file:

```javascript index.js
require("dotenv").config();
```

3. Next, we store the WorqHat API key and ORG key in variables for later use:

```javascript index.js
const worqhatApiKey = process.env.WORQHAT_API_KEY;
const worqhatOrgKey = process.env.WORQHAT_ORG_KEY;
```

4. Next, we set the URL for the API request:

```javascript index.js
const url = "https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v2";
```

5. Next, we set the required headers for the API request:

```javascript index.js
const headers = {
   "x-api-key": worqhatApiKey, // Replace with your API key
   "x-org-key": worqhatOrgKey, // Replace with your ORG key
   "Content-Type": "application/json",
};
```

6. Next, we prepare the request body in JSON format. This is where we specify the question or
command for the AI model and send the request to the API to get the response:

```javascript index.js
const raw = JSON.stringify({
   question: "Hi, tell me about you", // The question or command for the AI model
   preserve_history: false, // Whether to preserve conversation history for the model. Set to false for one-off questions. Visit documentation for more info.
   randomness: 0.4, // Level of randomness for AI model response (0 to 1)
});
```

This block of code is where the magic happens. We are sending a ``POST`` request to the WorqHat API,
and we are passing the ``question/command`` to the API. The API will then process the question/command
and return the ``response``.

* **question**: The question or command for the AI model (required)
* **preserve_history**: Whether to preserve conversation history for the model. Set to false for
one-off questions. You can also pass in custom training data and conversation history in the for
of Key-Value Pairs. Visit [documentation](https://devs.worqhat.com/WorqHatAPIs/AiText/aiconV2#sample-code) for more info.
* **randomness**: Level of randomness for AI model response (0 to 1). The higher the randomness, the
more varied the response will be.

7. Next, we configure the options for the API request:

```javascript index.js
const requestOptions = {
   url: url,
   method: "POST",
   headers: headers,
   body: raw,
};
```

This is where we specify the URL, HTTP method, headers, and request body that we have prepared
and send the request to the WorqHat API  to process the question/command and return the response.

8. Finally, we send the API request:

```javascript index.js
request(requestOptions, (error, response, body) => {
   if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
       console.log(body); // Print the response body if the request is successful
   } else {
       console.log("Error:", error); // Print the error message if the request fails
   }
});
```

This is where we send the API request to the WorqHat API and get the response. We are using the
`request` package to send the request. We are also checking if the request is successful or not
and printing the response body or error message accordingly.

### Step 6: Run the code

Now that we have written the code, let's run it and see what happens. To run the code, open the
terminal and run the following command:

```bash Terminal
node index.js
```

You should see the following output in the terminal:

```bash Terminal
{
  "id": "1d9affa3-deac-49ee-87e7-a8d0397826fb",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": 1683057609614,
  "content": "I was built by WorqHat, a Generative AI Based No-Code Platform Builder based on the Advanced LLM Model AiCon. It's a predictive technology that is designed to make building applications faster and easier. Is there anything you need help with?",
  "processing_count": 58
}
```

This is the response from the WorqHat API. The response contains the following information:

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``id`` | The unique ID of the response | 1d9affa3-deac-49ee-87e7-a8d0397826fb |
| ``status`` | The status of the response | success |
| ``timestamp`` | The timestamp of the response | 1683057609614 |
| ``content`` | The response from the AI model | I was built by WorqHat, a Generative AI Based No-Code Platform Builder based on the Advanced LLM Model AiCon. It's a predictive technology that is designed to make building applications faster and easier. Is there anything you need help with? |
| ``processing_count`` | The number of times the question/command was processed by the AI model | 58 |


<Check>Note: This code is using the super powerful AiCon V2 model from the WorqHat AI API, which is
  famous
  for
  generating some seriously impressive text. However, it's important to use the API in a responsible
  and ethical way, and be mindful of the model's limitations to avoid any misuse.</Check>

## Let’s Start Building

Now that you have learned how to use the WorqHat AI API, it's time to start building your own
application. Today we will be building a simple AI Code Generator application using the WorqHat AI
