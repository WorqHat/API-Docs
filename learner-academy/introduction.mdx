## About WorqHat Learner's Academy

+ **How do LLMs work?**
> LLMs are trained on a large amount of text data. They learn to predict the next word in a
sentence, given all the previous words. This is called language modeling. The better the language model, the better it can predict the next word. This is the basis of all LLMs. Learn about their architecture and their moving pieces, including transformer models, embeddings, similarity, and attention mechanisms.

+ **What are LLMs useful for?**
> LLMs are useful for a variety of tasks, including text generation, summarization, question
answering, and more. Learn about the different types of LLMs and how they can be used to solve
different problems, including text generation, summarization, question answering, web based search
and more

+ **How can I use LLMs to build and deploy my apps?**
> Learn how to use LLMs to build applications. This course will teach you how to use WorqHat's
AI Endpoints to build and deploy your applications.
