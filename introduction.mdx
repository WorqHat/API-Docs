## About WorqHat API

Welcome to WorqHat's Public API documentation.
This documentation was built to help you build your own custom integration with WorqHat's
REST-based Application Programming Interface (API).

The WorqHatAPI can be applied to virtually any task that you want to perform on the WorqHat Applications but from your own codebases. This involves understanding or generating natural language, code, images and voices; adding in custom form data to the records and even making changes to the No-Code Applications.

Some important notes to help you get started:

1) Access to WorqHat's API is currently only available for BETA customers on a rate-limited
basis.
2) Review our terms of service before getting started with the development.
