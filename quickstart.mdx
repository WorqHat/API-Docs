## Base Endpoint for all API calls

Right now, the API is only available on the **`https://api.worqhat.com`** domain. This is the only
official domain that is applicable for all API Calls to the Application.

The WorqHat API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request you are sending as a user is based on which Organization as all our Billings are rerouted to the Organization you are using the API keys for.

The WorqHat API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request. The
WorqHat API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. These docs are customized to your version of the API.

If you're using a version of the API that is older than the latest version, you may see older endpoints and outdated response schemas. We recommend that you use the latest version of the API whenever possible. We release new versions of the API frequently, so you may need to update your API integration periodically. We also send out email notifications about new versions of the API. You can subscribe to these notifications in your WorqHat account settings.

## Authentication

You can get your Organization's API Key and your API Key from the Workspace Admin Panel. You can
find the API Tokens screen under the Workspace Settings or by visiting the Developers Portal. You
can also find the API Tokens screen
by visiting the following URL:

````bash Organization Dashboard
https://$workspace.worqhat.app/workspace/developers
````

> $workspace is the name of your Workspace. You can find the name of your Workspace in the URL of your Workspace. For example, if your Workspace URL is https://myworkspace.worqhat.app, then your Workspace name is **myworkspace**.

<Card title="Visit Dashboard" icon="link" href="https://app.worqhat.com">
  You can also visit and choose between your Workspaces from the Accounts Dashboard.
</Card>

In case you are not the Admin/Leader/Developer of the Workspace, you will not be able to access
the API
Tokens screen. In such a case, please contact your Workspace Admin/Leader/Developer to get the
API Keys or request them to add you as a Developer to the Workspace.

You can copy the API Keys from the API Tokens screen and use them in your API Calls. You can also
generate new API Keys from the API Tokens screen. You can also delete the API Keys from the API
Tokens screen. Please note that deleting the API Keys will revoke access to the API for the
respective API Keys.

## Creating API Keys

In order to use the WorqHat API, you must first obtain an API key and the ORG Key. We offer a
genenrous free tier that gets reset every month. You can also upgrade to a paid plan to get more
API calls and more features.

This key serves
as a unique identifier that allows you to access WorqHat's API services. To generate an API key, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the [WorqHat API](https://worqhat.com) website and click on the **Get Started** button.
2. Join the WorqHat community by entering your email address and clicking on the **Join Now**
button. You can also sign up using your Google or Microsoft account.
3. Once you've signed up, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. Click on the **Create a
Workspace** button on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Add a name for your workspace and click on the **Create Workspace** button. We use workspaces
to organize your projects and keep them separate from each other. This allows you to manage your projects more efficiently.
5. Once you've created a workspace, you'll be redirected to the Workspace Signin page. Sign in to
your workspace using your email address and password that you have set up during the signup process.
6. After signing in, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. Click on the **Try Now** button on
the **Build Your Own Applications with our API** card.
7. You'll be redirected to the API page. You can find your API key and ORG key on the right-hand
side of the screen. Click on the **Copy** button to copy the keys to your clipboard.
8. Also, make sure to add your Domain name to the **Allowed Domains** section. This will allow
you to make API calls from your domain. For example, if you're making API calls from a website
hosted on `https://example.com`, you'll need to add `example.com` to the **Allowed Domains** section.

Here's an example of what the API key & ORG key looks like:


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ORG Key">
    ```bash API Key
    var myHeaders = new Headers();
    myHeaders.append("x-org-key",
    "U2FsdGVkX1+DMFucNFhZT7b3KTDTPLvjKkfWV0XY+jK2tA44wGn+M+KTC1V/eAOX");
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Key">
    ```bash ORG Key
    var myHeaders = new Headers();
    myHeaders.append("x-api-key",
    "U2FsdGVkX1/hx889OFajtqRp5TdESHHakovIb3Qq52kqqy/zFhA9MlNSjghXMUzbOHEr9QhoOAJKmKXKA6Ol8A==");
    ```
  </Tab>
